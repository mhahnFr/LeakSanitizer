# Welcome to the LeakSanitizer!
This repository contains a library which is designed to help finding leaks. It also has some features
to gain insights into the memory usage of your program.

## Usage
In order to get started, you can either download a compiled version of the library [here](https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/LeakSanitizer/releases).  
Alternatively, you can also build it from source:
- Clone the repository: ``git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/LeakSanitizer.git``
- and build the library: ``cd LeakSanitizer && make``.

On some systems, you might need to install the ``libexecinfo-dev`` to compile the library successfully.
If this is the case, add ``-lexecinfo`` to the linking flags.

In order to use this library, compile your code using the following flags: ``-Wno-gnu-include-next -I<path/to/library>/include``.

**Linking**:
- On **macOS**, link using these flags: ``-L<path/to/library> -llsan -lc++``.
- On **Linux**, link with ``-rdynamic -L<path/to/library> -llsan -ldl -lstdc++``.
- On **FreeBSD**, link with ``-rdynamic -L<path/to/library> -llsan -ldl -lexecinfo -lstdc++``.

Once the library is correctly linked with your code, it will show your memory leaks at exit.  
More features are described in the [wiki](https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/LeakSanitizer/wiki).

## Behind the scenes or: How does it work?
In order to track the memory allocations, the library provides a wrapper around the functions ``malloc``,
``realloc``, ``calloc`` and ``free``. Each allocation is registered and a backtrace for it is stored.

To not track itself, prior to the tracking part the allocation tracking is disabled.

The callstacks are created using the [CallstackLibrary](https://www.github.com/mhahnFr/CallstackLibrary).

When an allocation function is called for the first time, the ``atexit`` handler and the signal handlers
are installed. The ``atexit`` handler prints all allocations that are still registered when the program
exits.
